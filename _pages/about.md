I am a Ph.D. student at [WiNS Lab](http://carina.cse.lehigh.edu/winslab/index.php), [Lehigh University](https://www2.lehigh.edu/), under the supervision of Dr. [Mooi Choo Chuah](https://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~chuah/). Before joining Lehigh, I obtained my master's degree from [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) and my bachelor's degree from [China Agricultural University](https://en.cau.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on Computer Vision and Autonomous Driving. I have served as a reviewer for top-tier CV/ML/AI conferences (CVPR, AISTATS, WACV) as well as leading journals (TITS, TIV, TTRA).
